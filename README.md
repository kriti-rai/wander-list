# WanderList

## Intro

This sinatra-based app brings you the list of places to visit from all around the world (extracted from http://www.bbc.com/travel/destinations). One is able to sign up or log into their existing account where they will be able to create boards and pin trips they are interested in. Users will be able to view other users' boards but will be able to modify and update only the ones they have created and own.

## Installation

  To run the app, clone this git repo in your terminal and type:

    $ bundle install

  and execute

    $ shotgun

  Then view the application on your browser by copy-pasting the server location provided by shotgun.
